# ESP32 SDCard Wave File Example

This code shows how to record a WAV file to an SD Card attached to an ESP32.

There are two projects - one using Arduino and one using the Esspresif IDF. Both of these projects use PlatformIO to build.

# Arduino

The `arduino-wav-sdcard` folder has code that works on the current release of Arduino for the ESP32.

# IDF

The `idf-wav-sdcard` folder has code that works with the latest IDF release.
